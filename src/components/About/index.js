            Hi, my name is Sumit and I work as a Data Analyst In GlobalLogic
            India. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and
            Engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a passion for storytelling. I believe that words and data are
            the two most powerful tools to change the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            My day to the day work includes programming, working to derive
            insight from large datasets. My skills include data analysis,
            visualization, and machine learning
          </p>
          <p>
            You can take a look at some of my projects in the My Project section
            . I will link my work to their GitHub repositories, so feel free to
            download my code and play around with it. Most of my education has
            come from online platforms. I have downloaded e-books, audited
            courses on Udemy and Youtube, and spent countless hours on sites
            like FreeCodeCamp etc. I am grateful to online educators who have
            given me the opportunity to learn these things, and for
            democratizing education.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a very ambitious front-end developer looking for a role in an
            established IT company with the opportunity to work with the latest
            technologies on challenging and diverse projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm quiet confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on
            improving my chops one design problem at a time.
